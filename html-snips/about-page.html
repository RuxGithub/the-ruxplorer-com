          Rux is an identity.<br />It was created to express the sides of a
          person that they couldnt express otherwise <br />It was named after a
          resemblance to a name and the resemblance of it's state of mind to the
          meaning of
          <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/rux" target="_blank">rux</a
          >.<br />Being driven by the curiosity and wonder about why things are,
          how they work and how they are made, Rux came to explore them in a
          vast range of topics that are believed to not work well together.<br />With
          no real outlet or reason to apply what it found on the way, Rux
          started working on them regardless of the reason other than the desire
          to do so.<br />Between the complexity of not really existing and the
          existing constraint of time, it started chipping away into the depths
          of it's curiosity and bit by bit started to produce.<br />What it's
          producing, it will share with you here.<br />Feel free to explore
          alongside it.
